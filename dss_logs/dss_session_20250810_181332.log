a portal for documents

<think>
Okay, the user mentioned a portal for documents. Let me start by understanding the context. They need a purpose statement and stakeholder list for SPIDESOFT Step 2.1.

First, I need to gather more details. The industry sector and geographic location are crucial for compliance. The user hasnity specified these yet. So my first question should be to ask for the industry sector and primary geographic location of users/data. That will help in determining applicable regulations like GDPR for EU or HIPAA for healthcare in the US.

Next, the stakeholders. The user mentioned "a portal for documents," so the primary users would be employees, customers, patients. But I need to think beyond that. System roles like administrators, IT/Dev Team. Business roles like Legal, Management. External systems like third-party APIs, payment gateways. Also, malicious actors like thieves, hacktivists. I should prompt the user to elaborate on these, especially the malicious actors. Maybe they have specific threats in mind, like data breaches or unauthorized access.

The purpose statement should be comprehensive. It needs to explain the system's goals, value, and context. Maybe something about secure document management, access control, compliance. But I need to refine this based on the industry and location. For example, if it's healthcare in the EU, the purpose would include GDPR compliance and patient data protection.

In the analysis and caution, I should link the industry and location to specific regulations. For instance, if it's finance in the US, mention PCI-DSS. If it's healthcare in the EU, GDPR. Also, think about risks like data leakage, unauthorized access, and third-party vulnerabilities.

I need to make sure the stakeholders are detailed. Each role's security and privacy concerns must be clearly defined. For example, employees might be concerned about access control, while the legal team is worried about compliance. Malicious actors could target sensitive data or disrupt the portal.

I should also consider if there are any specific threats the user is aware of. Maybe they have a particular industry, like finance or healthcare, which would influence the stakeholders and regulations. The geographic location affects data storage laws and potential threats.

Finally, the next question should be about the industry sector and geographic location. Then, after getting that info, I can proceed to ask about the malicious actors and other stakeholders. But since the user hasn't provided that yet, I need to prompt them for that first.
