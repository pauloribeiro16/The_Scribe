a portal for documents

<think>
Okay, the user mentioned "a portal for documents." Let me break this down. The purpose is a portal, which is a system or platform for accessing and managing documents. But I need to figure out more details.

First, the user hasn't specified the industry or location. That's crucial because different industries have different regulations. For example, healthcare has HIPAA, finance has GDPR or PCI-DSS, etc. Without knowing the industry, I can't determine the specific compliance requirements.

Also, the location is important. If it's in the EU, GDPR applies. If it's in the US, maybe HIPAA or other US-specific laws. But the user hasn't mentioned either. So the top priority is to ask for the industry and location.

Stakeholders: The user hasn't mentioned any specific stakeholders yet. The portal's users could be employees, customers, or other parties. But since the user hasn't specified, I shouldn't assume any. The next question should be about the industry and location to get the necessary context for compliance and stakeholder identification.
