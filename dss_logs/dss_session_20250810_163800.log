I want to build a system that could be used for selling online things and make payments

<think>
Okay, the user wants to build a system for selling online things and making payments. Let me start by refining that statement. "A system for online selling and payments" sounds more formal.

Now, analyzing this. The system involves e-commerce, which means handling payments. That brings up security concerns like payment fraud, data breaches, and maybe PCI compliance. Also, the user didn't specify if it's a single platform or integrated with existing systems. There's also the aspect of payment gateways and handling different payment methods. Risks could include vulnerabilities in the payment processing, ensuring secure transactions, and compliance with regulations like GDPR or PCI DSS if they're handling user data.

The next question should ask about the integration needs. Do they want to integrate with existing platforms or third-party services? That will affect the system's architecture and security measures. Also, knowing the payment methods they support will help in ensuring the system is secure and compliant.

Yes

Okay, the user just said "Yes". That's a bit vague. I need to figure out what they're referring to. Since the previous example was about an app for patients, maybe they're confirming a previous statement. But without more context, it's hard to tell. I should ask for clarification on what exactly they need. Maybe they're agreeing to a purpose definition or confirming a previous response. To proceed, I need to ask a question that prompts them to specify their requirements. Let me make sure I'm following the SPIDESOFT methodology here. The key is to get a clear, precise purpose. So, I should ask a question that helps them define the main objective and scope of their software project.
