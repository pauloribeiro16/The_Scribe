### Demonstrative Example 3

The following Perl code is intended to look up the privileges for user ID's between 0 and 3, by performing an access of the $UserPrivilegeArray reference. It is expected that only userID 3 is an admin (since this is listed in the third element of the array).

**Nature**: Bad
```Perl
my $UserPrivilegeArray = ["user", "user", "admin", "user"];
                     my $userID = get_current_user_ID();
                     if ($UserPrivilegeArray eq "user") {print "Regular user!\n";}else {print "Admin!\n";}
                     print "\$UserPrivilegeArray = $UserPrivilegeArray\n";
```

In this case, the programmer intended to use "$UserPrivilegeArray->{$userID}" to access the proper position in the array. But because the subscript was omitted, the "user" string was compared to the scalar representation of the $UserPrivilegeArray reference, which might be of the form "ARRAY(0x229e8)" or similar.

### Extended Description

When the product accesses the resource using an incompatible type, this could trigger logical errors because the resource does not have expected properties. In languages without memory safety, such as C and C++, type confusion can lead to out-of-bounds memory access.

While this weakness is frequently associated with unions when parsing data with many different embedded object types in C, it can be present in any application that can interpret the same variable or memory location in multiple ways.

This weakness is not unique to C and C++. For example, errors in PHP applications can be triggered by providing array parameters when scalars are expected, or vice versa. Languages such as Perl, which perform automatic conversion of a variable of one type when it is accessed as if it were another type, can also contain these issues.

### Demonstrative Example 1

The following code uses a union to support the representation of different types of messages. It formats messages differently, depending on their type.

**Nature**: Bad
```C
#define NAME_TYPE 1#define ID_TYPE 2
                     struct MessageBuffer{int msgType;union {char *name;int nameID;};};
                     
                     int main (int argc, char **argv) {
                        struct MessageBuffer buf;char *defaultMessage = "Hello World";
                           buf.msgType = NAME_TYPE;buf.name = defaultMessage;printf("Pointer of buf.name is %p\n", buf.name);
                           /* This particular value for nameID is used to make the code architecture-independent. If coming from untrusted input, it could be any value. */
                           
                           buf.nameID = (int)(defaultMessage + 1);printf("Pointer of buf.name is now %p\n", buf.name);if (buf.msgType == NAME_TYPE) {printf("Message: %s\n", buf.name);}else {printf("Message: Use ID %d\n", buf.nameID);}
                     }
```

The code intends to process the message as a NAME_TYPE, and sets the default message to "Hello World." However, since both buf.name and buf.nameID are part of the same union, they can act as aliases for the same memory location, depending on memory layout after compilation.

Information in shared system resources also applies to encrypted representations of information. In other contexts, control of information in shared system resources is referred to as object reuse and residual information protection. Information in shared system resources does not address information remanence, which refers to the residual representation of data that has been nominally deleted; covert channels (including storage and timing channels), where shared system resources are manipulated to violate information flow restrictions; or components within systems for which there are only single users or roles.

**Control Statement:** a. Establish and document usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed; and b. Authorize each type of remote access to the system prior to allowing such connections.

**Discussion:** Remote access is access to organizational systems (or processes acting on behalf of users) that communicate through external networks such as the Internet. Types of remote access include dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations use encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity for remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs provides sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks if the cryptographic mechanisms used are implemented in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also affect the ability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls apply to systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public access. Authorization of each remote access type addresses authorization prior to allowing remote access without specifying the specific formats for such authorization. While organizations may use information exchange and system connection security agreements to manage remote access connections to other systems, such agreements are addressed as part of CA-3. Enforcing access restrictions for remote access is addressed via AC-3.

Therefore, organizations permit only qualified and authorized individuals to access systems for purposes of initiating changes. Access restrictions include physical and logical access controls (see AC-3 and PE-3), software libraries, workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (i.e., changes implemented into external interfaces rather than directly into systems), and change windows (i.e., changes occur only during specified times).

Employ the following controls to achieve the denial-of-service objective: [Assignment: organization-defined controls by type of denial-of-service event].

**Discussion:** Denial-of-service events may occur due to a variety of internal and external causes, such as an attack by an adversary or a lack of planning to support organizational needs with respect to capacity and bandwidth. Such attacks can occur across a wide range of network protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). A variety of technologies are available to limit or eliminate the origination and effects of denial-of-service events. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect system components on internal networks from being directly affected by or the source of denial-of-service attacks. Employing increased network capacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy also reduces the susceptibility to denial-of-service events. Related Controls: CP-2, IR-4, SC-6, SC-7, SC-40.

**Control Statement:** a. Identify [Assignment: organization-defined user actions] that can be performed on the system without identification or authentication consistent with organizational mission and business functions; and b. Document and provide supporting rationale in the security plan for the system, user actions not requiring identification or authentication.

**Discussion:** Specific user actions may be permitted without identification or authentication if organizations determine that identification and authentication are not required for the specified user actions. Organizations may allow a limited number of user actions without identification or authentication, including when individuals access public websites or other publicly accessible federal systems, when individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles are received. Organizations identify actions that normally require identification or authentication but may, under certain circumstances, allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be bypassed. Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable physical switch that commands bypass of the logon functionality and is protected from accidental or unmonitored use. Permitting actions without identification or authentication does not apply to situations where identification and authentication have already occurred and are not repeated but rather to situations where identification and authentication have not yet occurred. Organizations may decide that there are no user actions that can be performed on organizational systems without identification and authentication, and therefore, the value for the assignment operation can be “none.” Related Controls: AC-8, IA-2, PL-2.

**Control Statement:** Require individuals accessing the system to employ [Assignment: organization-defined supplemental authentication techniques or mechanisms] under specific [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances or situations].

**Discussion:** Adversaries may compromise individual authentication mechanisms employed by organizations and subsequently attempt to impersonate legitimate users. To address this threat, organizations may employ specific techniques or mechanisms and establish protocols to assess suspicious behavior. Suspicious behavior may include accessing information that individuals do not typically access as part of their duties, roles, or responsibilities; accessing greater quantities of information than individuals would routinely access; or attempting to access information from suspicious network addresses. When pre-established conditions or triggers occur, organizations can require individuals to provide additional authentication information. Another potential use for adaptive authentication is to increase the strength of mechanism based on the number or types of records being accessed. Adaptive authentication does not replace and is not used to avoid the use of multi-factor authentication mechanisms but can augment implementations of multi-factor authentication.

Use an alternative information source for the execution of essential functions or services on [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components] when the primary source of information is corrupted or unavailable.

**Discussion:** Actions taken by a system service or a function are often driven by the information it receives. Corruption, fabrication, modification, or deletion of that information could impact the ability of the service function to properly carry out its intended actions. By having multiple sources of input, the service or function can continue operation if one source is corrupted or no longer available. It is possible that the alternative sources of information may be less precise or less accurate than the primary source of information. But having such sub-optimal information sources may still provide a sufficient level of quality that the essential service or function can be carried out, even in a degraded or debilitated manner.

**Discussion:** Increasing the diversity of information technologies within organizational systems reduces the impact of potential exploitations or compromises of specific technologies. Such diversity protects against common mode failures, including those failures induced by supply chain attacks. Diversity in information technologies also reduces the likelihood that the means adversaries use to compromise one system component will be effective against other system components, thus further increasing the adversary work factor to successfully complete planned attacks. An increase in diversity may add complexity and management overhead that could ultimately lead to mistakes and unauthorized configurations. Related Controls: AU-9, PL-8, SC-27, SC-30, SR-3.

### Base Control: SC-29 (HETEROGENEITY)

**Control Statement:** Employ a diverse set of information technologies for the following system components in the implementation of the system: [Assignment: organization-defined system components].

**Discussion:** Increasing the diversity of information technologies within organizational systems reduces the impact of potential exploitations or compromises of specific technologies. Such diversity protects against common mode failures, including those failures induced by supply chain attacks. Diversity in information technologies also reduces the likelihood that the means adversaries use to compromise one system component will be effective against other system components, thus further increasing the adversary work factor to successfully complete planned attacks. An increase in diversity may add complexity and management overhead that could ultimately lead to mistakes and unauthorized configurations. Related Controls: AU-9, PL-8, SC-27, SC-30, SR-3.

--- Provided Context ---
From CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')):
### Demonstrative Example 1

The following code uses a union to support the representation of different types of messages. It formats messages differently, depending on their type.

**Nature**: Bad
```C
#define NAME_TYPE 1#define ID_TYPE 2
                     struct MessageBuffer{int msgType;union {char *name;int nameID;};};
                     
                     int main (int argc, char **argv) {
                        struct MessageBuffer buf;char *defaultMessage = "Hello World";
                           buf.msgType = NAME_TYPE;buf.name = defaultMessage;printf("Pointer of buf.name is %p\n", buf.name);
                           /* This particular value for nameID is used to make the code architecture-independent. If coming from untrusted input, it could be any value. */
                           
                           buf.nameID = (int)(defaultMessage + 1);printf("Pointer of buf.name is now %p\n", buf.name);if (buf.msgType == NAME_TYPE) {printf("Message: %s\n", buf.name);}else {printf("Message: Use ID %d\n", buf.nameID);}
                     }
```

The code intends to process the message as a NAME_TYPE, and sets the default message to "Hello World." However, since both buf.name and buf.nameID are part of the same union, they can act as aliases for the same memory location, depending on memory layout after compilation.

From CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')):
### Extended Description

When the product accesses the resource using an incompatible type, this could trigger logical errors because the resource does not have expected properties. In languages without memory safety, such as C and C++, type confusion can lead to out-of-bounds memory access.

While this weakness is frequently associated with unions when parsing data with many different embedded object types in C, it can be present in any application that can interpret the same variable or memory location in multiple ways.

This weakness is not unique to C and C++. For example, errors in PHP applications can be triggered by providing array parameters when scalars are expected, or vice versa. Languages such as Perl, which perform automatic conversion of a variable of one type when it is accessed as if it were another type, can also contain these issues.

---

From CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')):
### Demonstrative Example 3

The following Perl code is intended to look up the privileges for user ID's between 0 and 3, by performing an access of the $UserPrivilegeArray reference. It is expected that only userID 3 is an admin (since this is listed in the third element of the array).

**Nature**: Bad
```Perl
my $UserPrivilegeArray = ["user", "user", "admin", "user"];
                     my $userID = get_current_user_ID();
                     if ($UserPrivilegeArray eq "user") {print "Regular user!\n";}else {print "Admin!\n";}
                     print "\$UserPrivilegeArray = $UserPrivilegeArray\n";
```

In this case, the programmer intended to use "$UserPrivilegeArray->{$userID}" to access the proper position in the array. But because the subscript was omitted, the "user" string was compared to the scalar representation of the $UserPrivilegeArray reference, which might be of the form "ARRAY(0x229e8)" or similar.

### Common Consequences

* **Scope**: Availability, Integrity, Confidentiality
  **Impact**: Read Memory, Modify Memory, Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands, DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart

From CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')):
### Description

The product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.

From NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5:
### Base Control: AC-17 (REMOTE ACCESS)

**Control Statement:** a. Establish and document usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed; and b. Authorize each type of remote access to the system prior to allowing such connections.

**Discussion:** Remote access is access to organizational systems (or processes acting on behalf of users) that communicate through external networks such as the Internet. Types of remote access include dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations use encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity for remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs provides sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks if the cryptographic mechanisms used are implemented in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also affect the ability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls apply to systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public access. Authorization of each remote access type addresses authorization prior to allowing remote access without specifying the specific formats for such authorization. While organizations may use information exchange and system connection security agreements to manage remote access connections to other systems, such agreements are addressed as part of CA-3. Enforcing access restrictions for remote access is addressed via AC-3.

From NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5:
### Base Control: AC-14 (PERMITTED ACTIONS WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION OR AUTHENTICATION)

**Control Statement:** a. Identify [Assignment: organization-defined user actions] that can be performed on the system without identification or authentication consistent with organizational mission and business functions; and b. Document and provide supporting rationale in the security plan for the system, user actions not requiring identification or authentication.

**Discussion:** Specific user actions may be permitted without identification or authentication if organizations determine that identification and authentication are not required for the specified user actions. Organizations may allow a limited number of user actions without identification or authentication, including when individuals access public websites or other publicly accessible federal systems, when individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles are received. Organizations identify actions that normally require identification or authentication but may, under certain circumstances, allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be bypassed. Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable physical switch that commands bypass of the logon functionality and is protected from accidental or unmonitored use. Permitting actions without identification or authentication does not apply to situations where identification and authentication have already occurred and are not repeated but rather to situations where identification and authentication have not yet occurred. Organizations may decide that there are no user actions that can be performed on organizational systems without identification and authentication, and therefore, the value for the assignment operation can be “none.” Related Controls: AC-8, IA-2, PL-2.

Question: How can I mitigate CWE-843 using NIST 800-53 controls?

Answer:
2025-08-08 18:23:35 - 
========================= FINAL RESPONSE =========================
2025-08-08 18:23:35 - Response: To mitigate the risk associated with CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type or 'Type Confusion'), you can implement several NIST 800-53 Rev. 5 Base Controls, which serve as guidance for enhancing an organization's security posture:

1. **AC-17 (REMOTE ACCESS):** This control focuses on managing remote access to systems. You should establish and document strict usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and guidelines for every type of allowed remote access. Prior authorization is crucial before granting any remote connections; this ensures that only validated users can attempt access. By implementing these practices, you restrict the potential exploitation of 'Type Confusion' through malicious inputs or misuse of resources in different types.

2. **AC-14 (PERMITTED ACTIONS WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION OR AUTHENTICATION):** Although less directly relevant to preventing type confusion (since it pertains to actions performed by users without authentication), understanding this control is still important for overall security hygiene. If certain user actions are permitted without identification or authentication, assess whether these can potentially be abused via 'Type Confusion' attacks. Implement proper identity and access management practices for those actions when feasible, ensuring they're protected against such exploitation.

3. **SC-6 (RESOURCE AVAILABILITY):** This control addresses resource protection by prioritizing or limiting the usage of essential resources based on need. It's crucial to ensure that critical systems handling diverse types are not overwhelmed or disrupted due to improperly managed resource allocation, which could exacerbate problems caused by 'Type Confusion'. By enforcing resource availability controls, you reduce the impact of potential system instability stemming from type-related issues.

4. **CM-5 (ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE):** When executing changes to systems that might affect operations related to data types or access patterns, impose stringent physical and logical access restrictions. This control ensures that only authorized personnel can initiate modifications. By limiting change permissions and requiring strong verification processes before implementation, you minimize the likelihood of introducing 'Type Confusion' vulnerabilities during system updates.

5. **SC-29 (HETEROGENEITY):** Implementing this control advises using a variety of distinct technologies for critical components within your system design. By employing heterogeneous systems and diverse information technology stacks, you inherently reduce the risk posed by 'Type Confusion' since it's more challenging for an attacker to exploit multiple dissimilar systems concurrently or sequentially. This diversity also enhances defense resilience against supply chain attacks that might target specific software components.

6. **AC-3 (PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION):** Physical security is pivotal in preventing unauthorized access to your facilities and devices, thus safeguarding the integrity of data types used by your applications. Ensuring controlled environments limit physical tampering or observation of system internals can help guard against certain type confusion attacks targeting memory manipulation techniques.

By integrating these NIST 800-53 controls into your security framework, you'll create a robust defense strategy that addresses the risks associated with CWE-843 and strengthens overall resilience against various cyber threats including 'Type Confusion'.
