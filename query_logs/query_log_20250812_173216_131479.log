You are an expert routing analyst for a cybersecurity knowledge base. Your task is to select the correct documents to search based on a user's query by applying a strict set of rules.

**Available Documents:**
{
  "GDPR": "A European Union regulation on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU.",
  "DORA": "A European Union regulation for the financial sector focusing on digital operational resilience.",
  "NIS2 Directive": "A European Union directive on cybersecurity for critical infrastructure sectors.",
  "NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5": "A comprehensive catalog of security and privacy controls for U.S. federal information systems.",
  "NIST CSF 2.0": "A high-level framework for managing cybersecurity risk, organized by Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.",
  "ISO/IEC 27002:2022": "An international standard providing a catalog of information security controls to support an ISO 27001 ISMS.",
  "CWE": "A list of common software and hardware weakness types (e.g., CWE-79 for Cross-Site Scripting).",
  "CAPEC": "A dictionary of known patterns of attack used by adversaries.",
  "D3FEND": "A knowledge graph of defensive cybersecurity techniques and countermeasures."
}

**User Query:**
"Let's begin. Based on the context, what is the first regulation we should consider?"

**EXPERT RULES FOR SELECTION:**
1.  **GDPR:** If the query mentions 'personal data', 'privacy', 'employees', 'users', or 'customers', you MUST select 'GDPR'.
2.  **DORA:** You should ONLY select 'DORA' if the query explicitly mentions 'financial services', 'banking', 'insurance', or 'fintech'.
3.  **NIS2 Directive:** You should ONLY select 'NIS2 Directive' if the query explicitly mentions a critical infrastructure sector like 'energy', 'transport', 'healthcare', 'water management', or 'digital infrastructure'. For a generic internal IT tool or document portal, NIS2 is **NOT** relevant.
4.  **CWE/CAPEC/D3FEND:** If the query mentions specific vulnerabilities, attack patterns, or defensive techniques (e.g., 'SQL Injection', 'phishing', 'mitigation'), you should select 'CWE', 'CAPEC', and 'D3FEND'.
5.  **NIST/ISO Standards:** If the query is about general security best practices, controls, or management (e.g., 'risk management', 'access control policies'), select 'NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5', 'NIST CSF 2.0', and 'ISO/IEC 27002:2022'.

Based on these strict rules, which document(s) are the correct choice? Respond with ONLY a JSON list of the selected document names.

<think>
Okay, let's break down the user's query. The user is asking, "Let's begin. Based on the context, what is the first regulation we should consider?" But there's no specific context provided here. Wait, maybe the initial question is part of a larger conversation, but in this case, the user hasn't given any specific details about the scenario. Hmm.

Looking at the expert rules, the selection depends on the query's context. Since the user's query is very general, just asking about the first regulation to consider, I need to see if any of the documents are applicable here. The rules say that if the query mentions certain keywords, then specific documents are selected. But in this case, the query doesn't mention any of the keywords like 'personal data', 'financial services', 'critical infrastructure', or specific vulnerabilities.

So, the user's query is too vague. However, maybe the initial question is part of a scenario where the user is starting a discussion about regulations. But according to the rules, without specific mentions, none of the documents would be selected. Wait, but maybe the user is asking in a general sense, so perhaps the answer is that no specific document is selected because the query doesn't mention any of the triggers. But the rules say to select the correct documents based on the query's context. Since there's no context, maybe the answer is that no documents are selected. However, the user is asking for the first regulation, so maybe the default is to pick the most relevant one. But according to the rules, if there's no mention of any of the keywords, none of the documents are selected. So the correct answer would be an empty list. But I need to check the rules again.

Rule 1: GDPR is for personal data, privacy, etc. The query doesn't mention those. Rule 2: DORA for financial services, which isn't mentioned. Rule 3: NIS2 for critical infrastructure, not mentioned. Rules 4 and 5 are about vulnerabilities, attacks, or general security practices, which aren't mentioned either. So none of the documents are applicable. Therefore, the correct answer is an empty list.
